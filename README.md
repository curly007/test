# leadingedgehealth/test

This repo is already set up for unit testing so you should be able to verify
it is working immediately like so:

```
git clone git@github.com:leadingedgehealth/test.git
cd test
composer install
phpunit
```

If things are working correctly, then the above will fail in a controlled
PHPUnit manner.
